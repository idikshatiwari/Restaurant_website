Completely Dynamic website Routing with React Router


WORKING:
The complete data is getting requested from firebase Realtime database, the components use that data to display the results, the components in menu, offers and other sections can then directly be modified by simply modifying the data in database, for example if the price of something changes or the image of some dish changes you don't have to modify the code, simply make the change in databse and it will be reflected on the website. For the routing purpose react-router is used and specifically hashBrowserRouter is used because it has enchanced performance on react Hosting. The hosting is done on firebase at Website
